# USMART_Emulator
 
Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an emulator throught UnetStack for USMART Project. 
All the codes developped on Python will be used and the information will be transferred to FakeModem on UnetStack where a simulation is running all the nodes.
105 nodes (1 baseAnchor, 4 anchorDeamons, 100 sensorDeamons) have been placed on a square space. All of the nodes contains on PythonAgent and an API address that permit the connection with Python throught a socket.
